# Xcode Integration

## Problem
Xcode is a key target application for automation, but it has a complex UI that requires specialized handling to effectively automate common tasks.

## Approach
Develop Xcode-specific element mappings, create high-level actions for common Xcode tasks, implement project navigation helpers, and add build/run/debug automation capabilities.

## Implementation Plan
1. Develop Xcode-specific element mappings
2. Create high-level actions for common Xcode tasks
3. Implement project navigation helpers
4. Add build/run/debug automation

## Failed Approaches
N/A (initial implementation)

## Testing
- Test Xcode element mappings with various Xcode versions
- Verify high-level actions work correctly
- Test project navigation helpers
- Verify build/run/debug automation works as expected

## Documentation
- Document Xcode-specific functionality
- Provide examples of common Xcode automation tasks

## Implementation
Not yet implemented

## Tasks
**CRITICAL: The instructions in this file are not optional guidelines - they are ALL MANDATORY requirements. DO NOT SKIP STEPS**

- [ ] Plan your implementation
- [ ] Ensure that all implementation tasks are listed in this TODO list. 

### Gate 1: Pre-Implementation 

Before writing ANY implementation code, confirm completion of ALL of these tasks:
- [ ] All previous work is committed to git.
- [ ] You are on a branch for this issue, branched from the most recent issue's branch
- [ ] Required directories created
- [ ] Create new failing tests for this functionality.
- [ ] Verify that new tests run to completion and fail


### Gate 2: Implement the functionality

- [ ] Map Xcode UI element structure
- [ ] Create Xcode-specific element selectors
- [ ] Implement project navigation helpers
- [ ] Add file opening/editing actions
- [ ] Create build command actions
- [ ] Implement run/debug actions
- [ ] Add scheme selection functionality
- [ ] Implement test running capabilities
- [ ] Create high-level convenience methods for common tasks

### Gate 3: Mid-Implementation Review 

After implementing core functionality:
- [ ] Verify all completed code adheres to ALL requirements in this file and in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Confirm test coverage for all implemented features

### Gate 4: Pre-Completion Verification

Before declaring the task complete perform these MANDATORY checks:
- [ ] Run ALL verification commands (tests, linting, typechecking)
- [ ] Write function-level documentation for all functions explaining what they do, their parameters, return values, and usage examples where appropriate.
- [ ] Add explanatory comments for any non-obvious or tricky code that might confuse another experienced developer who isn't familiar with this specific codebase.
- [ ] Update the README.md. It should always include:
	- [ ] a set of examples showing how to use all the commandline tools in the project. 
	- [ ] how to run the test suite
	- [ ] steps needed to set up a development environment
- [ ] Run the unit tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output

### Gate 5: Final commit for the issue 
- [ ] Audit all uncommitted files in your working copy
	- [ ] Make sure that all files are either committed or, if they're temporary files, removed.
- [ ] Author a meaningful commit message for this change. Include details of your intent, as well as logs showing that you ran tests and that they passed.

FAILURE TO PASS ANY GATE INVALIDATES THE WHOLE IMPLEMENTATION. 
YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL YOU CLEAR GATE 5.
NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have tests. If you believe tests aren't needed, ask the human to confirm by typing "YOU CAN SKIP THE TESTS, JUST THIS ONCE"
