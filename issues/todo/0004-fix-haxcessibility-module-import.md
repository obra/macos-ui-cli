# Fix Haxcessibility Module Import

## Problem
The Haxcessibility library is not being properly imported as a module when the HAXCESSIBILITY_AVAILABLE flag is defined. This causes compilation errors and prevents the application from utilizing the Haxcessibility functionality.

## Approach
Properly integrate the Haxcessibility Objective-C library with the Swift package by:
1. Ensuring the Haxcessibility library is properly built
2. Configuring the module map correctly
3. Setting the right compiler and linker flags

## Implementation Plan
1. Investigate the current module map and bridging header setup
2. Properly build the Haxcessibility library as a dependency
3. Configure the correct include paths and module structure
4. Update the module map and bridging configuration
5. Fix the import statements in Swift code

## Failed Approaches
Simply adding the HAXCESSIBILITY_AVAILABLE flag didn't resolve the issue. The module import still fails because the Haxcessibility library is not properly set up as a Swift module.

## Testing
- Test building the project with HAXCESSIBILITY_AVAILABLE flag
- Verify that imports in Swift code work properly
- Confirm the correct functionality in the application when run

## Documentation
- Update README.md with proper build instructions
- Document the Haxcessibility integration process

## Implementation
Not yet implemented

## Tasks
**CRITICAL: The instructions in this file are not optional guidelines - they are ALL MANDATORY requirements. DO NOT SKIP STEPS**

- [ ] Plan your implementation
- [ ] Ensure that all implementation tasks are listed in this TODO list. 

### Gate 1: Pre-Implementation 

Before writing ANY implementation code, confirm completion of ALL of these tasks:
- [ ] All previous work is committed to git.
- [ ] You are on a branch for this issue, branched from the most recent issue's branch
- [ ] Required directories created
- [ ] Create new failing tests for this functionality.
- [ ] Verify that new tests run to completion and fail


### Gate 2: Implement the functionality

- [ ] Investigate current module setup and identify issues
- [ ] Fix module map configuration
- [ ] Update Objective-C bridging header setup
- [ ] Configure proper build settings for Haxcessibility
- [ ] Fix import statements in Swift code
- [ ] Resolve path issues for header files
- [ ] Configure proper linking of Haxcessibility

### Gate 3: Mid-Implementation Review 

After implementing core functionality:
- [ ] Verify all completed code adheres to ALL requirements in this file and in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Confirm test coverage for all implemented features

### Gate 4: Pre-Completion Verification

Before declaring the task complete perform these MANDATORY checks:
- [ ] Run ALL verification commands (tests, linting, typechecking)
- [ ] Write function-level documentation for all functions explaining what they do, their parameters, return values, and usage examples where appropriate.
- [ ] Add explanatory comments for any non-obvious or tricky code that might confuse another experienced developer who isn't familiar with this specific codebase.
- [ ] Update the README.md. It should always include:
	- [ ] a set of examples showing how to use all the commandline tools in the project. 
	- [ ] how to run the test suite
	- [ ] steps needed to set up a development environment
- [ ] Run the unit tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output

### Gate 5: Final commit for the issue 
- [ ] Audit all uncommitted files in your working copy
	- [ ] Make sure that all files are either committed or, if they're temporary files, removed.
- [ ] Author a meaningful commit message for this change. Include details of your intent, as well as logs showing that you ran tests and that they passed.

FAILURE TO PASS ANY GATE INVALIDATES THE WHOLE IMPLEMENTATION. 
YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL YOU CLEAR GATE 5.
NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have tests. If you believe tests aren't needed, ask the human to confirm by typing "YOU CAN SKIP THE TESTS, JUST THIS ONCE"
