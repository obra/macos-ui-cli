# Security and Permissions

## Problem
Accessibility APIs require special permissions, and our tool needs to handle security considerations properly, including secure handling of sensitive UI data and proper permission request workflows.

## Approach
Implement secure handling of sensitive UI data, document security considerations, and ensure our tool properly requests and validates accessibility permissions.

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement secure handling of sensitive UI data
2. Document security considerations
3. Ensure proper permission request and validation

## Failed Approaches
N/A (initial implementation)

## Testing
- Test permission request workflows
- Verify secure handling of sensitive data
- Test permission validation

## Documentation
- Document security considerations and best practices
- Provide guidance on permissions required

## Implementation
Not yet implemented

## Tasks
**CRITICAL: The instructions in this file are not optional guidelines - they are ALL MANDATORY requirements. DO NOT SKIP STEPS**

- [ ] Plan your implementation
- [ ] Ensure that all implementation tasks are listed in this TODO list. 

### Gate 1: Pre-Implementation 

Before writing ANY implementation code, confirm completion of ALL of these tasks:
- [ ] All previous work is committed to git.
- [ ] You are on a branch for this issue, branched from the most recent issue's branch
- [ ] Required directories created
- [ ] Create new failing tests for this functionality.
- [ ] Verify that new tests run to completion and fail


### Gate 2: Implement the functionality

- [ ] Review and enhance permission request workflows
- [ ] Implement secure handling of sensitive UI data
- [ ] Add permission validation checks
- [ ] Create permission troubleshooting tools
- [ ] Document security considerations
- [ ] Implement secure storage of settings
- [ ] Add security warning prompts where needed
- [ ] Create security best practices documentation

### Gate 3: Mid-Implementation Review 

After implementing core functionality:
- [ ] Verify all completed code adheres to ALL requirements in this file and in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Confirm test coverage for all implemented features

### Gate 4: Pre-Completion Verification

Before declaring the task complete perform these MANDATORY checks:
- [ ] Run ALL verification commands (tests, linting, typechecking)
- [ ] Write function-level documentation for all functions explaining what they do, their parameters, return values, and usage examples where appropriate.
- [ ] Add explanatory comments for any non-obvious or tricky code that might confuse another experienced developer who isn't familiar with this specific codebase.
- [ ] Update the README.md. It should always include:
	- [ ] a set of examples showing how to use all the commandline tools in the project. 
	- [ ] how to run the test suite
	- [ ] steps needed to set up a development environment
- [ ] Run the unit tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output

### Gate 5: Final commit for the issue 
- [ ] Audit all uncommitted files in your working copy
	- [ ] Make sure that all files are either committed or, if they're temporary files, removed.
- [ ] Author a meaningful commit message for this change. Include details of your intent, as well as logs showing that you ran tests and that they passed.

FAILURE TO PASS ANY GATE INVALIDATES THE WHOLE IMPLEMENTATION. 
YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL YOU CLEAR GATE 5.
NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have tests. If you believe tests aren't needed, ask the human to confirm by typing "YOU CAN SKIP THE TESTS, JUST THIS ONCE"
