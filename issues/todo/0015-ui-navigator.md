# UI Navigator: Curses-Style Interface for Accessibility Exploration

## Problem
The current command-line interface, while functional, doesn't provide an intuitive visual representation of UI elements in a way that matches the actual application layout. Exploring complex UI hierarchies and interacting with elements requires remembering commands and typing them out, which can be cumbersome.

## Approach
Implement a curses-style terminal UI that:
1. Displays UI elements in a layout similar to the actual application
2. Allows navigation through elements using arrow keys
3. Provides interactive selection and action execution
4. Shows available actions for each element

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a terminal UI framework using either NCurses or a Swift-native terminal UI library
2. Implement a visual tree representation that preserves UI hierarchy and layout
3. Build a navigation system with keyboard controls (arrow keys, tab, etc.)
4. Add element selection and action execution capabilities
5. Implement a panel showing element details and available actions
6. Create utilities for rendering UI elements with approximated layout

## Failed Approaches
N/A (initial proposal)

## Testing
- Test UI rendering with various applications and UI structures
- Verify keyboard navigation functions correctly
- Test element selection and action execution
- Validate proper display of element properties and actions
- Ensure proper cleanup of terminal state on exit

## Documentation
- Document UI navigator commands and usage
- Provide keyboard shortcut reference
- Detail how to navigate, select elements, and execute actions
- Document how to customize the display

## Implementation Tasks

### Core Components
- **TerminalUIManager**: Handles terminal setup, rendering, and cleanup
- **UITreeRenderer**: Converts element hierarchies to a visual representation
- **NavigationController**: Handles keyboard input and navigation
- **ElementActionPanel**: Displays and executes element actions
- **LayoutApproximator**: Attempts to preserve spatial relationships between elements

### Detailed Implementation Plan

#### Terminal UI Framework
- Research and select appropriate terminal UI library (NCurses, Vapor Terminal, etc.)
- Create abstraction layer over the chosen library
- Implement window/panel management
- Set up keyboard input handling

#### UI Tree Renderer
- Create specialized tree rendering that preserves spatial relationships
- Implement various element renderers based on role (button, checkbox, etc.)
- Develop a color scheme for different element types
- Add highlighting for selected elements and interactive indicators

#### Navigation System
- Implement directional navigation (arrow keys)
- Add depth navigation (enter to go deeper, backspace to go back)
- Create breadcrumb navigation for showing current path
- Implement tab navigation for jumping between major UI sections

#### Element Details Panel
- Show detailed element properties in a side panel
- List all available actions for the selected element
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for executing actions
- Display help text and element relationships

#### Command Integration
- Add `navigate` command to launch the UI navigator
- Allow passing in application/window selectors
- Implement export functionality to convert exploration to shell commands

### Task List
- [ ] Research terminal UI libraries and select the best option
- [ ] Create basic terminal UI management system
- [ ] Implement screen layout with main view and details panel
- [ ] Build UI element tree renderer with spatial awareness
- [ ] Develop keyboard input controller
- [ ] Implement navigation system for moving through the UI
- [ ] Create element selection and highlighting
- [ ] Build element details and actions panel
- [ ] Implement action execution from navigator
- [ ] Add color schemes and visual indicators
- [ ] Create help overlay and keyboard shortcut reference
- [ ] Integrate with existing command structure
- [ ] Add export functionality to generate commands
- [ ] Implement proper terminal cleanup on exit
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for UI navigator
- [ ] Document usage and keyboard shortcuts

## Design Considerations
1. **Layout Approximation**: While we can't perfectly recreate the application's layout, we can approximate positions using accessibility frame data and parent-child relationships.

2. **Visual Representation**: Use Unicode box-drawing characters and colors to visually distinguish element types and relationships.

3. **Performance**: For large UI hierarchies, implement lazy loading and rendering of elements to maintain performance.

4. **Accessibility**: Ensure the UI navigator itself follows accessibility best practices with clear indicators and consistent navigation.

5. **Graceful Fallback**: Provide a fallback text-only mode for terminals that don't support advanced features.

## Further Enhancements (Future Work)
- **Live Updates**: Dynamically update the UI view when the target application changes
- **Search**: Add search functionality to quickly find elements
- **Filtering**: Allow filtering the view by element role or properties
- **Scripting**: Allow recording sequences of actions for later playback
- **Split View**: Add option to show side-by-side comparison with actual screenshot
- **Custom Views**: Save and load custom views focusing on specific parts of the UI
