# Output Formatting

## Problem
The CLI tool needs to present UI element information in a clear, readable format, with options for different output formats to support both human readability and integration with other tools.

## Approach
Implement various output formats (text, JSON, XML), add verbosity options, create visualizations of element hierarchies, and implement colorized output for better readability.

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement various output formats (text, JSON, XML)
2. Add verbose/quiet mode options
3. Create visualization of element hierarchy
4. Implement colorized output for readability

## Failed Approaches
N/A (initial implementation)

## Testing
- Test output in different formats (text, JSON, XML)
- Verify verbosity levels work as expected
- Test element hierarchy visualization
- Verify colorized output is readable in different terminal environments

## Documentation
- Document output format options
- Provide examples of different output formats

## Implementation
Implemented a flexible output formatting system with multiple output formats (text, JSON, XML), verbosity levels, and colorized output options. The implementation includes:

1. An OutputFormatter protocol that defines a common interface for all formatters
2. Three formatter implementations: PlainTextFormatter, JSONFormatter, and XMLFormatter
3. Global options for format, verbosity, and colorization
4. A factory for creating formatters based on output preferences
5. Integration with all commands for consistent formatting

## Tasks
**CRITICAL: The instructions in this file are not optional guidelines - they are ALL MANDATORY requirements. DO NOT SKIP STEPS**

- [x] Plan your implementation
- [x] Ensure that all implementation tasks are listed in this TODO list. 

### Gate 1: Pre-Implementation 

Before writing ANY implementation code, confirm completion of ALL of these tasks:
- [x] All previous work is committed to git.
- [x] You are on a branch for this issue, branched from the most recent issue's branch
- [x] Required directories created
- [x] Create new failing tests for this functionality.
- [x] Verify that new tests run to completion and fail


### Gate 2: Implement the functionality

- [x] Design output formatting protocol/interface
- [x] Implement plain text output formatter
- [x] Implement JSON output formatter
- [x] Implement XML output formatter
- [x] Add verbosity level controls
- [x] Create element hierarchy visualization
- [x] Implement colorized output functionality
- [x] Add format selection via command-line flags

### Gate 3: Mid-Implementation Review 

After implementing core functionality:
- [x] Verify all completed code adheres to ALL requirements in this file and in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Confirm test coverage for all implemented features

### Gate 4: Pre-Completion Verification

Before declaring the task complete perform these MANDATORY checks:
- [x] Run ALL verification commands (tests, linting, typechecking)
- [x] Write function-level documentation for all functions explaining what they do, their parameters, return values, and usage examples where appropriate.
- [x] Add explanatory comments for any non-obvious or tricky code that might confuse another experienced developer who isn't familiar with this specific codebase.
- [x] Update the README.md. It should always include:
	- [x] a set of examples showing how to use all the commandline tools in the project. 
	- [x] how to run the test suite
	- [x] steps needed to set up a development environment
- [x] Run the unit tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output

### Gate 5: Final commit for the issue 
- [x] Audit all uncommitted files in your working copy
	- [x] Make sure that all files are either committed or, if they're temporary files, removed.
- [x] Author a meaningful commit message for this change. Include details of your intent, as well as logs showing that you ran tests and that they passed.

FAILURE TO PASS ANY GATE INVALIDATES THE WHOLE IMPLEMENTATION. 
YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL YOU CLEAR GATE 5.
NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have tests. If you believe tests aren't needed, ask the human to confirm by typing "YOU CAN SKIP THE TESTS, JUST THIS ONCE"
