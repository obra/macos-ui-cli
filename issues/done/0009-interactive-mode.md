# Interactive Mode

## Problem
Command-line interactions can be cumbersome for exploring and manipulating UI elements. An interactive shell would provide a more user-friendly experience for exploration and testing.

## Approach
Implement an interactive shell mode for the CLI tool with features like tab completion, command history, and context awareness to make UI exploration and manipulation more efficient.

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement interactive shell for exploration
2. Add tab completion for commands and UI elements
3. Create history functionality for command recall
4. Build context awareness (current app/window/element)

## Failed Approaches
N/A (initial implementation)

## Testing
- Test interactive shell functionality
- Verify tab completion works for commands and elements
- Test history recall functionality
- Verify context awareness correctly tracks current state

## Documentation
- Document interactive mode commands and usage
- Provide examples of interactive exploration workflows

## Implementation
Interactive mode has been implemented with the following features:

1. REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) using LineNoise-Swift library
2. Command history for recalling previous commands
3. Tab completion for commands and contextual options
4. Context awareness of the current application, window, and element
5. Hierarchical navigation through the UI elements
6. Command hints and help system
7. Support for quoted arguments and escape sequences
8. Colorized output and informative prompts
9. Clear error handling and user feedback

The implementation includes:
- InteractiveMode.swift: Main REPL implementation with command handling
- ElementFinder.swift: Utility for finding and filtering UI elements
- InteractiveModeTests.swift: Tests for the interactive mode functionality
- Updated UtilityCommands.swift to include the interactive command

## Tasks
**CRITICAL: The instructions in this file are not optional guidelines - they are ALL MANDATORY requirements. DO NOT SKIP STEPS**

- [x] Plan your implementation
- [x] Ensure that all implementation tasks are listed in this TODO list. 

### Gate 1: Pre-Implementation 

Before writing ANY implementation code, confirm completion of ALL of these tasks:
- [x] All previous work is committed to git.
- [x] You are on a branch for this issue, branched from the most recent issue's branch
- [x] Required directories created
- [x] Create new failing tests for this functionality.
- [x] Verify that new tests run to completion and fail


### Gate 2: Implement the functionality

- [x] Create interactive shell infrastructure
- [x] Implement REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop)
- [x] Add command parsing for interactive mode
- [x] Implement tab completion for commands
- [x] Add tab completion for UI element paths
- [x] Create command history functionality
- [x] Implement context tracking (current app/window/element)
- [x] Add context-aware commands
- [x] Implement interactive help system

### Gate 3: Mid-Implementation Review 

After implementing core functionality:
- [x] Verify all completed code adheres to ALL requirements in this file and in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Confirm test coverage for all implemented features

### Gate 4: Pre-Completion Verification

Before declaring the task complete perform these MANDATORY checks:
- [x] Run ALL verification commands (tests, linting, typechecking)
- [x] Write function-level documentation for all functions explaining what they do, their parameters, return values, and usage examples where appropriate.
- [x] Add explanatory comments for any non-obvious or tricky code that might confuse another experienced developer who isn't familiar with this specific codebase.
- [x] Update the README.md. It should always include:
	- [x] a set of examples showing how to use all the commandline tools in the project. 
	- [x] how to run the test suite
	- [x] steps needed to set up a development environment
- [x] Run the unit tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output

### Gate 5: Final commit for the issue 
- [x] Audit all uncommitted files in your working copy
	- [x] Make sure that all files are either committed or, if they're temporary files, removed.
- [x] Author a meaningful commit message for this change. Include details of your intent, as well as logs showing that you ran tests and that they passed.

FAILURE TO PASS ANY GATE INVALIDATES THE WHOLE IMPLEMENTATION. 
YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL YOU CLEAR GATE 5.
NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have tests. If you believe tests aren't needed, ask the human to confirm by typing "YOU CAN SKIP THE TESTS, JUST THIS ONCE"
