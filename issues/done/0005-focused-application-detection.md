# Issue: Improve Focused Application Detection

## Gate 1: Tests

- [x] Write tests to verify the application detection works
- [x] Test that accessibility wrapper creation works
- [x] Test that the application detection APIs handle edge cases

## Gate 2: Implementation

- [x] Fix SystemAccessibility.getFocusedApplication() implementation:
  - Add NSWorkspace fallback when HAXSystem focusedApplication returns nil
- [x] Fix SystemAccessibility.getAllApplications() implementation:
  - Use NSWorkspace.runningApplications to get all running applications
  - Convert these to HAXApplication instances
- [x] Fix ApplicationManager.getApplicationByName() to actually work with real applications
- [x] Update README to properly document app wrapper requirements

## Gate 3: Review

- [x] Ensure the implementation correctly identifies focused applications in all cases
- [x] Verify there are no memory leaks or performance issues
- [x] Ensure the code correctly follows Swift style and best practices

## Gate 4: Documentation

- [x] Update README with detailed information about accessibility permissions
- [x] Add comprehensive documentation about the app wrapper approach
- [x] Update the examples to consistently use app wrapper paths
- [x] Document how to use aliases for convenience
- [x] Add technical details explaining why the app wrapper is necessary

## Gate 5: Verification

- [x] Verify accessibility permissions checks work
- [x] Verify getFocusedApplication() returns correct results
- [x] Verify getAllApplications() returns all running applications
- [x] Verify application lookup by name works correctly
- [x] Test new commands with app wrapper to confirm functionality

## Notes

The key issue was that the app wrapper approach was created but not fully documented in the README. Additionally, the actual implementation of application lookup methods was incomplete. The SystemAccessibility class was returning empty results for getAllApplications() and inconsistent results for getFocusedApplication().

The fixes add proper implementation for these methods and thoroughly explain the app wrapper in the documentation. Now users understand that they must create and use the app wrapper to make the accessibility APIs work.

Fixed warnings in the code related to unnecessary conditional casts.
