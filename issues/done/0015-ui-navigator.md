# UI Navigator: Curses-Style Interface for Accessibility Exploration

## Problem
The current command-line interface, while functional, doesn't provide an intuitive visual representation of UI elements in a way that matches the actual application layout. Exploring complex UI hierarchies and interacting with elements requires remembering commands and typing them out, which can be cumbersome.

## Approach
Implement a curses-style terminal UI that:
1. Displays UI elements in a layout similar to the actual application
2. Allows navigation through elements using arrow keys
3. Provides interactive selection and action execution
4. Shows available actions for each element

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a terminal UI framework using either NCurses or a Swift-native terminal UI library
2. Implement a visual tree representation that preserves UI hierarchy and layout
3. Build a navigation system with keyboard controls (arrow keys, tab, etc.)
4. Add element selection and action execution capabilities
5. Implement a panel showing element details and available actions
6. Create utilities for rendering UI elements with approximated layout

## Implementation Status
âœ… COMPLETED

Implemented a comprehensive UI Navigator that provides interactive accessibility exploration with the following features:
- Intuitive UI element tree visualization 
- Keyboard navigation through element hierarchy
- Rich element information display with all accessibility properties
- Action execution support for all standard accessibility actions
- Hierarchy optimization to improve readability
- Clear visual indicators for element state and relationships

## Testing
- Tested UI rendering with various applications and UI structures
- Verified keyboard navigation functions correctly
- Tested element selection and action execution
- Validated proper display of element properties and actions
- Ensured proper cleanup of terminal state on exit

## Documentation
- Documented UI navigator commands and usage
- Provided keyboard shortcut reference
- Detailed how to navigate, select elements, and execute actions
- Documented how to customize the display
