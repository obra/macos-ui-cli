# AccessibilityExplorer: Development Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic working explorer with both mock and real accessibility data
- ✅ Safe exploration of application UI hierarchies
- ✅ Property inspection with timeouts and safety mechanisms
- ✅ Simplified single-file implementation for easier maintenance

## Core Development Plan

### Phase 1: Code Organization & Architecture
- [ ] Refactor single-file implementation into a proper module structure
  - [ ] Create separate files for models (Element, Application)
  - [ ] Create separate files for views (Sidebar, Tree, Properties)
  - [ ] Create dedicated AccessibilityBridge module for API access
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging system
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functionality

### Phase 2: Enhanced Element Discovery
- [ ] Add search capability for finding elements by criteria
  - [ ] Search by role (all buttons, all text fields)
  - [ ] Search by name or content
  - [ ] Search by position/area
- [ ] Add element filtering options
  - [ ] Filter visible elements only
  - [ ] Filter actionable elements only
- [ ] Implement visual element highlighting in target applications
  - [ ] Overlay element bounds on screen
  - [ ] Indicate selected element with highlight

### Phase 3: Element Interaction
- [ ] Implement basic element actions
  - [ ] Click buttons
  - [ ] Enter text in fields
  - [ ] Toggle checkboxes
  - [ ] Select menu items
- [ ] Add support for drag operations
- [ ] Implement keyboard event simulation
- [ ] Create sequence recorder for action playback

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add element change monitoring
  - [ ] Watch for property changes
  - [ ] Detect new/removed elements
- [ ] Create snapshot capability for UI state
  - [ ] Export element hierarchies
  - [ ] Compare snapshots for differences
- [ ] Add scripting support
  - [ ] Export actions as scripts
  - [ ] Allow script editing and playback
- [ ] Implement accessibility audit capabilities
  - [ ] Check for missing labels
  - [ ] Verify contrast ratios
  - [ ] Test keyboard navigation

## Technical Challenges to Address

### Stability & Performance
- [ ] Implement enhanced timeouts with configurable settings
- [ ] Add CPU/memory monitoring with throttling
- [ ] Create background processing for long operations
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed elements

### User Experience
- [ ] Add dark mode support
- [ ] Create persistent settings
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for common tasks
- [ ] Add proper error messages and recovery options
- [ ] Create welcome/tutorial screens

### Security & Permissions
- [ ] Handle permission request failures gracefully
- [ ] Add sandbox-compatible operations
- [ ] Implement proper entitlements for App Store distribution
- [ ] Create privacy policy document

## Implementation Priorities

1. **First milestone:** Enhanced element discovery with search & filtering
   - This provides the most immediate value to users
   - Improves the exploration experience significantly

2. **Second milestone:** Basic element interaction
   - Adds the ability to click buttons and enter text
   - Makes the tool functional for basic UI testing

3. **Third milestone:** Snapshot and comparison
   - Enables more complex testing scenarios
   - Provides value for regression testing

4. **Fourth milestone:** Advanced scripting and automation
   - Completes the tool as a comprehensive automation solution
   - Enables integration with CI/CD systems

## Resources Needed
- macOS Accessibility API documentation
- SwiftUI advanced layout techniques
- Window management and overlay techniques
- Event monitoring and simulation techniques

## Risk Mitigation
- Always maintain a Safe Mode that uses mock data
- Implement exponential backoff for API calls
- Create self-monitoring system to detect performance problems
- Use isolation and process separation for high-risk operations
