// ABOUTME: This file provides mock declarations for the Haxcessibility framework.
// ABOUTME: It enables testing code that depends on Haxcessibility without needing the real framework.

// Note: We'll comment out this file for now as we're having namespace conflicts with the actual Haxcessibility framework
// For our testing needs, we'll rely on the actual implementation classes instead of mocks
