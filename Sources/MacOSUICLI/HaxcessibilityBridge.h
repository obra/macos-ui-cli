// ABOUTME: This file acts as a bridging header between Swift and the Objective-C Haxcessibility library.
// ABOUTME: It imports all necessary Haxcessibility headers for use in Swift code.

// We don't need this bridging header anymore since we're importing Haxcessibility directly
// as a Swift module. This file is kept for reference and backward compatibility.

// The Haxcessibility module is now imported directly in Swift code with:
// import Haxcessibility
